--------------------
These are used to join multiple tables.We can reduce multiple tables of data into single query.

Three Concepts available in mysql to handle with Multiple tables 

1.Joins

what is UNION AND UNION ALL 

lets say we have table 1 and table 2

Table1    Table2
1          3
3          5
5          6

UNION :

It will extract data from the two tables but it eliminates the duplicates .

1
3
5
6

UNION ALL :

It will extract data from the two tables but it wont elimate the duplicates .

When ever we use UNION AND UNION ALL we need to consider below points 

The UNION Operator is used to combine the result set of two or more select statements
Each select statement with in the UNION must have same number of columns 
The column must also have similar data types 
The columns in Each select statement must also be in the same order



Question that we can solve by using UNION AND UNION ALL :
=========================================================
1)Display all the records from mulitple tables with out duplicates 
select * from table1 union select * from table2;

2)Display all the records from multiple tables with duplicates 
select * from table1 union all select * from table2;
